# Tutorial Objective

Robots are widely used in industrial production environments and increasingly in logistics, healthcare, and home appliances. Most of the traditional robot systems are being operated by a PLC and/or a specific robot controller. But even while being isolated from industrial networks (air gapped), these machines are not free from harm. Both human safety and product quality are at stake. But more increasingly flexible, autonomous and versatile robots have entered into the industrial domain. Collaborative robots are being released from their cages and put in close cooperation with humans. That positive trend also sees a significant decline in cost for robotics. Partially thanks to the availability of standard technologies, such as Internet / IoT, OPC UA, ROS, ROS 2, cloud, Azure Sphere, and the interconnectivity of the robotic systems. But most of the robotic systems lack a fundamental cybersecurity posture.


The variety of architectures, including controller operated robots, PLC operated robots, ROS operated robots, and IoT or cloud operated robots, enables the versatility and diversity of potential vulnerabilities to robotic systems. There are different approaches possible in trying to improve the robots' cybersecurity. These have to be systematic from an industrial perspective, depending on the risk they impose on the factory and the situation. Isolation is a start, hardening access control, putting cryptographic measures in place, and improving the application security are basic measures. The robot manufacturers can ensure security-by-design for the robot controllers, the robots, and the applications instructing and controlling them. This tutorial aims to present materials on this emerging area of research and provide a multi-disciplinary perspective on cybersecurity. This tutorial will serve as a comprehensive introduction of this emerging topic for theoreticians and practitioners working in the field. This tutorial will also provide educational materials that will foster a sub-community in robotics and allow more contributors to become part of the community.
