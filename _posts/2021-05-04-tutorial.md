# Tutorial



## Prerequisite knowledge

This tutorial is self-contained. Basic knowledge about *distributed systems* and *network security* is helpful but not necessary. A basic understanding of robotic systems is sufficient.

## Outline

Contemporary robotic systems are vulnerable to diverse attack patterns, and an a posteriori hardening is at least challenging, if not impossible at all. This tutorial aims to stipulate the inclusion of security in robotics from the earliest design phases onward and with a special focus on the cost-benefit tradeoff that can otherwise be an inhibitor for the fast development of affordable systems. We aim to introduce new quantitative methods of security management and design, extending known vulnerability scoring systems to the distinguished setting of robotic systems, and accounting for the highly distributed nature of robots as an interplay of potentially very many components. A powerful quantitative approach to model-based security is offered by game theory, providing a rich spectrum of techniques to optimize security against various kinds of attacks. Such a multiperspective view on security is necessary to address the heterogeneity and complexity of robotic systems.
