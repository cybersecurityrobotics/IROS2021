**Module 1** presents the *security challenges in robotic systems*. We will introduce ROS vulnerabilities, known vulnerabilities in industrial robot systems, and the challenge of securing robots. We will also show ROS demos and penetration testing tools to demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerabilities.
 
 
**Module 2** presents the *security overview, common security practices and design tools for robotic systems*. We will introduce materials related to penetration testing, DevSecOps, and vulnerabilities and scoring systems.
 

**Module 3** focuses on the *quantitative methods of modeling and design strategic defenses*. This module introduces common threat models and game-theoretic frameworks that can be used for risk assessment and strategic defense design.
