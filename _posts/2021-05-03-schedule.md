**Module 1** presents the *security challenges in robotic systems*. We will introduce ROS vulnerabilities and how to exploit them, known vulnerabilities in industrial robot systems, and the challenge of securing robots. 

 

**Module 2** presents the *security practices and design tools for robotic systems*. We will introduce materials related to penetration testing, DevSecOps, and vulnerabilities and scoring systems.

 

**Module 3** focuses on the *quantitative methods of modeling and design strategic defenses*. This module introduces common threat models and game-theoretic frameworks that can be used for risk assessment and strategic defense design.

 

**Module 4** presents the *security practice in action*. We will give demos of penetration testing ROS using RosPenTo, Alurity toolbox for robot cybersecurity, and the ransomware threats.
